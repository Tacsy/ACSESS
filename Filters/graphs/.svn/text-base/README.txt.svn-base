Overview
========

The main header file, graph.h, contains declarations of all the
functions available.  Here are the main ones to consider:

gp_New() - allocates an empty graph structure and returns a pointer to it.
                Example: graphP theGraph = gp_New();

gp_Free() - frees a graph data structure and nulls out the pointer. 
                Take care to pass the address of the pointer returned by gp_New()
                Example: gp_Free(&theGraph);
                
gp_Read() - initializes a given graph, then adds edges to it according 
                to content of a given file.
                Example: if (gp_Read(theGraph, "file.txt") != OK) error
                
gp_Write() - writes the graph to a file in an adjacency list and adjacency
                matrix formats
                Example: gp_Write(theGraph, "out.txt", WRITE_ADJLIST);

gp_Embed() - the main function that receives a graph and rearranges its
                adjacency lists to produce either a combinatorial planar 
                embedding or a minimal non-planar subgraph.
                Example: Result = gp_Embed(theGraph, EMBEDFLAGS_PLANAR);
                 
gp_SortVertices() - can be used after gp_Embed() to recover the original 
                        numbering of the graph that appeared, for example, in 
                        the input file.  By default, gp_Embed() assumes that the 
                        graph should remain with its depth first search numbering, 
                        not the original numbering.
                        Example: gp_SortVertices(theGraph);

To create graphs without reading them from a file, the following additional
functions are useful:

gp_InitGraph() - given N, this function allocates within a graph structure 
                        enough memory for N vertices and 3N edges.
                        Example: 
                        
gp_AddEdge() - allows the addition of a single edge to a previously created 
                and initialized graph.
                Example: if (gp_AddEdge(theGraph, u, 0, v, 0) != OK) error
