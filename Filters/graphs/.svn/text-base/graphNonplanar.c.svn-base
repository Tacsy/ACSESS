 _MarkHighestXYPath()

 An X-Y path in the bicomp rooted by R is a path attached to the external
 face at points Px and Py that separates W from R such that a back edge (R, W)
 cannot be embedded within the bicomp. Recall that R is a root copy of I, so
 (R, W) is the representative of (I, W).  Also, note that W is pertinent if
 either W *or* one of its descendants in a separate bicomp has, in the input 
 graph, a back edge to I.

 If no X-Y path separating W from R is found, then NOTOK is returned because
 this procedure is only called once an X-Y path is guaranteed (by our proof
 of correctness) to exist.

 The desired output is to set the 'visited' flags of the X-Y path with
 highest points of attachment to the external face (i.e. the points of
 attachment that are closest to R along the external face).  This includes
 marking both the vertices and edges along the X-Y path.

 As a function of initialization, the vertices along the external face
 (other than R and W) have been classified as 'high RXW', 'low RXW', 'high RXY', 
 or 'low RXY'. Once the vertices have been categorized, we proceed with trying 
 to set the visitation flags in the way described above.  To do this, we first 
 remove all edges incident to R except the two edges that join R to the external 
 face. The result is that R and its two remaining edges are a 'corner' in the
 external face but also in a single proper face whose boundary includes the
 X-Y path with the highest attachment points. Thus, we simply need to walk
 this proper face to find the desired X-Y path. Note, however, that the
 resulting face boundary may have attached cut vertices.  Any such separable
 component contains a vertex neighbor of R, but the edge to R has been
 temporarily removed.  The algorithm removes loop of vertices and edges along
 the proper face so that only a path is identified.

 To walk the proper face containing R, we begin with its link[0] successor,
 then take the link[1] corner at every subsequent turn.  For each vertex,
 we mark as visited the vertex as well as the edge used to enter the vertex
 (except for the edge used to enter the RXW vertex).  We also push the visited
 vertices and edges onto a stack.

 As we walk the proper face, we keep track of the last vertex P_x we visited of
 type RXW (high or low).  Each time we encounter a vertex of type RXW (high or
 low), we pop the stack and unmark all of the edges and vertices visited because
 they were part of a path parallel to the external face that does not obstruct
 W from reaching R within the bicomp.  If we encounter vertex W, then there is
 no obstructing X-Y path since we removed only edges incident to R, so we pop
 the stack unmarking everything then return NOTOK as stated above.  If we
 encounter a vertex Z previously visited, then we pop the stack, unmarking the
 vertices and edges popped, until we find the prior occurence of Z on the stack.

 Otherwise, the first time we encounter a vertex P_y of type 'RYW', we stop
 because the obstructing X-Y path has been marked visited and its points of
 connection P_x and P_y have been found.

 Once the X-Y path is identified, we restore the edges incident to R.

 The stack space used is no greater than 3N.  The first N accounts for removing
 the edges incident to R.  The other 2N accounts for the fact that each
 iteration of the main loop visits a vertex, pushing its index and the
 location of an edge record.  If a vertex is encountered that is already
 on the stack, then it is not pushed again (and in fact part of the stack
 is removed).

 _MarkZtoRPath()

 This function assumes that _MarkHighestXYPath() has already been called,
 which marked as visited the vertices and edges along the X-Y path.

 We begin at the point of attachment P_x and traverse its link[1] edge records
 until we find one marked visited, which leads to the first internal vertex
 along the X-Y path.  We begin with this vertex (and its edge of entry), and
 we run until we find P_y.  For each internal vertex Z and its edge of entry
 ZPrevArc, we take the link[1] successor edge record of ZPrevArc (skipping Z
 if it intervenes).  This is called ZNextArc.  If ZNextArc is marked visited
 then it is along the X-Y path, so we use it to exit Z and go to the next
 vertex on the X-Y path.

 If ZNextArc is not visited, then when _MarkHighestXYPath() ran, it exited
 Z from ZNextArc, then eventually reentered Z.  In other words, Z became a
 cut vertex when we removed the internal edges incident to R. Thus, ZNextArc
 indicates the first edge in an internal path to R.

 When we find an unvisited ZNextArc, we stop running the X-Y path and instead
 begin marking the Z to R path.  We move to successive vertices using a
 twin arc then a link[1] successor edge record, only this time we have not
 removed the internal edges incident to R, so this technique does eventually
 lead us all the way to R.

 If we do not find an unvisited ZNextArc for any vertex Z on the X-Y path and
 inside the bicomp, then there is no Z to R path, so we return.
