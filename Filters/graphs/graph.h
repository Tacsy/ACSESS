/* Data members needed by vertices and edges

   Vertices
        v: Carries original vertex number (same as array index)
                DFSNumber then uses it to store DFI.
                SortVertices then restores original vertex numbers when vertices
                are put in DFI order (i.e. not same as array index)
        visited: helps detect vertex visitation during various algorithms
                such as Walkup
        link: array indices that 'point' to the start and end of the edge list

        type: Used by Kuratowski subgraph isolator to classify vertices when
                searching for certain paths in a biconnected component.
        sign: Unused

   Edges
        v: The edge record for (u,v) will be in u's list and store the index of
                the neighbour v. Starts out being original vertex number, but
                SortVertices renumbers to DFI so we get constant time access.
        visited: helps detect edge visitation, e.g. during the initial depth
                        first search, during a face reading, and during
                        Kuratowski subgraph isolation
        link: Linkages to other edges in an adjacency list.
        type: Used by DFSNumber to classify edges as DFSCHILD, DFSPARENT,
                FORWARD, BACK or SHORTCIRCUIT. See macro definitions above.
        sign: Initialized to 1, may become -1 during embedding.
                For planar embedder, set to -1 on the DFSCHILD edge record of
                the root edge of a bicomp that is flipped.  Used to recover
                consistent vertex orientation in each bicomp.

/* Additional data members needed only by vertices
        DFSParent: The DFI of the DFS tree parent of this vertex
        leastAncestor: min(DFI of neighbors connected by backedge)
        Lowpoint: min(leastAncestor, min(Lowpoint of DFS Children))
        adjacentTo: Used by the embedder; during walk-up, each vertex that is
                directly adjacent via a back edge to the vertex currently 
                being embedded will have the forward edge's index stored in 
                this field.  During walkdown, each vertex whose AdjacentTo 
                field is set will cause a back edge to be embedded.
        pertinentBicompList: used by Walkup to store a list of child bicomps of
                a vertex descendant of the current vertex that are pertinent
                and must be merged by the Walkdown in order to embed the cycle
                edges of the current vertex.  In this implementation,
                externally active pertinent child bicomps are placed at the end
                of the list as an easy way to make sure all internally active
                bicomps are processed first.
        separatedDFSChildList: contains list DFS children of this vertex in
                non-descending order by Lowpoint (sorted in linear time).
                When merging bicomp rooted by edge (r, c) into vertex v (i.e.
                merging root copy r with parent copy v), the vertex c is
                removed from the separatedDFSChildList of v.
                A vertex's status-- inactive, internally active, externally
                active-- is determined by the lesser of its leastAncestor and
                the least lowpoint from among only those DFS children that
                aren't in the same bicomp with the vertex.
        fwdArcList: at the start of embedding, the back edges from a vertex
                to its DFS descendants are separated from the main adjacency
                list and placed in a circular list until they are embedded.
                This member indicates a node in that list.
