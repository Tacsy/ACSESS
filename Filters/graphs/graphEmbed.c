 _CreateSortedSeparatedDFSChildLists()
 We create a separatedDFSChildList in each vertex which contains the
 Lowpoint values of the vertex's DFS children sorted in non-descending order.
 To accomplish this in linear time for the whole graph, we must not
 sort the DFS children in each vertex, but rather bucket sort the
 Lowpoint values of all vertices, then traverse the buckets sequentially,
 adding each vertex to its parent's separatedDFSChildList.
 Note that this is a specialized bucket sort that achieves O(n)
 worst case rather than O(n) expected time due to the simplicity
 of the sorting problem.  Specifically, we know that the Lowpoint values
 are between 0 and N-1, so we create buckets for each value.
 Collisions occur only when two keys are equal, so there is no
 need to sort the buckets (hence O(n) worst case).

 _MergeVertex()
 The merge step joins the vertex W to the root R of a child bicompRoot,
 which is a root copy of W appearing in the region N to 2N-1.

 Actually, the first step of this is to redirect all of the edges leading
 into R so that they indicate W as the neighbor instead of R.
 For each edge node pointing to R, we set the 'v' field to W.  Once an
 edge is redirected from a root copy R to a parent copy W, the edge is
 never redirected again, so we associate the cost of the redirection
 as constant per edge, which maintains linear time performance.

 After this is done, a regular circular list union occurs. The only
 consideration is that WPrevLink is used to indicate the two edge
 records e_w and e_r that will become consecutive in the resulting
 adjacency list of W.  We set e_w to W's link[WPrevLink] and e_r to
 R's link[1^WPrevLink] so that e_w and e_r indicate W and R with
 opposing links, which become free to be cross-linked.  Finally,
 the edge record e_ext, set equal to R's link[WPrevLink], is the edge
 that, with e_r, held R to the external face.  Now, e_ext will be the
 new link[WPrevLink] edge record for W.  If e_w and e_r become part
 of a proper face, then e_ext and W's link[1^WPrevLink] are the two
 edges that hold W to the external face.

 _WalkDown()
 Consider a circular shape with small circles and squares along its perimeter.
 The small circle at the top the root vertex of the bicomp.  The other small
 circles represent internally active vertices, and the squares represent
 externally active vertices.  The root vertex is a root copy of I, the
 vertex currently being processed.

 The Walkup previously marked all vertices adjacent to I by setting their
 adjacentTo flags.  Basically, we want to walkdown both the link[0] and 
 then the link[1] sides of the bicomp rooted at RootVertex, embedding edges
 between it and descendants of I with the adjacentTo flag set.  It is sometimes
 necessary to hop to child biconnected components in order to reach the desired
 vertices and, in such cases, the biconnected components are merged together
 such that adding the back edge forms a new proper face in the biconnected
 component rooted at RootVertex (which, again, is a root copy of I).

 The outer loop performs both walks, unless the first walk got all the way
 around to RootVertex (only happens when bicomp contains no external activity,
 such as when processing the last vertex), or when non-planarity is 
 discovered (in a pertinent child bicomp such that the stack is non-empty).

 For the inner loop, each iteration visits a vertex W.  If W is adjacentTo I,
 we call MergeBicomps to merge the biconnected components whose cut vertices
 have been collecting in theStack.  Then, we add the back edge (RootVertex, W)
 and clear the adjacentTo flag in W.

 Next, we check whether W has a pertinent child bicomp.  If so, then we figure
 out which path down from the root of the child bicomp leads to the next vertex
 to be visited, and we push onto the stack information on the cut vertex and
 the paths used to enter into it and exit from it.  Alternately, if W
 had no pertinent child bicomps, then we check to see if it is inactive.
 If so, we find the next vertex along the external face, then short-circuit
 its inactive predecessor (under certain conditions).  Finally, if W is not 
 inactive, but it has no pertinent child bicomps, then we already know its 
 adjacentTo flag is clear so both criteria for internal activity also fail.  
 Therefore, W must be a stopping vertex.

 A stopping vertex X is an externally active vertex that has no pertinent
 child bicomps and no unembedded back edge to the current vertex I.
 The inner loop of Walkdown stops walking when it reaches a stopping vertex X 
 because if it were to proceed beyond X and embed a back edge, then X would be 
 surrounded by the bounding cycle of the bicomp.  This is clearly incorrect 
 because X has a path leading from it to an ancestor of I (which is why it's 
 externally active), and this path would have to cross the bounding cycle.

 After the loop, if the stack is non-empty, then the Walkdown halted because
 it could not proceed down a pertinent child biconnected component along either
 path from its root, which is easily shown to be evidence of a K_3,3, so
 we break the outer loop.  The caller performs further tests to determine
 whether Walkdown has embedded all back edges.  If the caller does not embed
 all back edges to descendants of the root vertex after walking both RootSide 
 0 then 1 in all bicomps containing a root copy of I, then the caller can 
 conclude that the input graph is non-planar.

 _OrientVerticesInBicomp()
  As a result of the work done so far, the edges around each vertex have
 been put in order, but the orientation may be counterclockwise or
 clockwise for different vertices within the same bicomp.
 We need to reverse the orientations of those vertices that are not
 oriented the same way as the root of the bicomp.

 During embedding, a bicomp with root edge (v', c) may need to be flipped.
 We do this by inverting the root copy v' and implicitly inverting the
 orientation of the vertices in the subtree rooted by c by assigning -1
 to the sign of the DFSCHILD edge record leading to c.

 We now use these signs to help propagate a consistent vertex orientation
 throughout all vertices that have been merged into the given bicomp.
 The bicomp root contains the orientation to be imposed on all parent
 copy vertices.  We perform a standard depth first search to visit each
 vertex.  A vertex must be inverted if the product of the edge signs
 along the tree edges between the bicomp root and the vertex is -1.

 Finally, the PreserveSigns flag, if set, performs the inversions
 but does not change any of the edge signs.  This allows a second
 invocation of this function to restore the state of the bicomp
 as it was before the first call.
