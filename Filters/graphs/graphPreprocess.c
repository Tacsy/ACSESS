 Assigns Depth First Index (DFI) to each vertex.  Also records parent
 of each vertex in the DFS tree, and marks DFS tree edges that go from
 parent to child.  Forwared arc cycle edges are also distinguished from
 edges leading from a DFS tree descendant to an ancestor-- both DFS
 edges and back arcs.  This last type is marked with EDGE_BACK, which the
 embedder ignores.  Because the embedder works in reverse DFI order,
 only forward arcs to children are needed because only the DFS descendants
 of a vertex have already been embedded.

 This implementation requires that the vertices be sorted in DFI order
 (such that the edge records contain DFI values in their v fields).  An
 implementation could be made to run before sorting using the fact that
 the value G[G[e].v].v before sorting is equal to G[e].v after the sort.

 For computing Lowpoint, we must do a post-order traversal of the DFS tree.
 We push the root of the DFS tree, then we loop while the stack is not empty.
 We pop a vertex; if it is not marked, then we are on our way down the DFS
 tree, so we mark it and push it back on, followed by pushing its
 DFS children.  The next time we pop the node, all of its children
 will have been popped, marked+children pushed, and popped again.  On
 the second pop of the vertex, we can therefore compute the Lowpoint
 values based on the childrens' Lowpoints and the edges in the vertex's
 adjacency list.

 A stack of size N suffices because we push each vertex only once.
