 gp_CheckEmbeddingIntegrity()

 This function traverses all faces of a graph structure containing
 the planar embedding that results from gp_Embed().  The algorithm
 begins by placing all of the graph's arcs onto a stack and marking
 all of them as unvisited.  For each arc popped, if it is visited,
 it is immediately discarded and the next arc is popped.  Popping an
 unvisited arc J begins a face traversal.  We move to the true twin
 arc K of J, and obtain its link[0] successor arc L.  This amounts to
 always going clockwise or counterclockwise (depending on how the
 graph is drawn on the plane, or alternately whether one is above
 or below the plane).  This traversal continues until we make it
 back to J.  Each arc along the way is marked as visited.  Further,
 if L has been visited, then there is an error since an arc can only
 appear in one face (the twin arc appears in a separate face, which
 is traversed in the opposing direction).
 If this algorithm succeeds without double visiting any arcs, and it
 produces the correct face count according to Euler's formula, then
 the embedding has all vertices oriented the same way.
 NOTE:  Because a vertex is in its adj. list, if we go to a link[0]
        and it is a vertex, we simply take the vertex's link[0].
 NOTE:  In disconnected graphs, the face reader counts the external
        face of each connected component.  So, we adjust the face
        count by subtracting one for each component, then we add one
        to count the external face shared by all components.

 gp_CheckKuratowskiSubgraphIntegrity()

 This function checks whether theGraph received as input contains
 either a K_5 or K_{3,3} homeomorph.

 To be a K_5 homeomorph, there must be exactly 5 vertices of degree 4,
 which are called 'image' vertices, and all other vertices must be
 either degree 2 or degree 0. Furthermore, each of the image vertices
 must be able to reach all of the other image vertices by a single edge
 or a path of degree two vertices.

 To be a K_{3,3} homeomorph, there must be exactly 6 vertices of degree 3,
 which are called 'image' vertices, and all other vertices must be either
 degree 2 or degree 0.  Furthermore, the image vertices must be connected
 by edges or paths of degree two vertices in the manner suggested by
 a K_{3,3}.  To test this, we select an image vertex U, and determine
 three image vertices X, Y and Z reachable from U by single edges or
 paths of degree 2 vertices.  Then, we check that the two remaining image
 vertices, V and W, can also reach X, Y and Z by single edges or paths of
 degree 2 vertices.

 It is not necessary to check that the paths between the image vertices
 are distinct since if the paths had a common vertex, then the common
 vertex would not be degree 2.
